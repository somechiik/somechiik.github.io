        <h3>
            Hey there, I’m Andrea. Professional multitasker, chaos coordinator, and recovering perfectionist. My life’s
            a juggling act: full-time job, full-time college student at Southern Utah University, Tech-Moms coding grad
            (w00t!),
            homeschooling mom to an amazing son with a different operating system, daughter, wife,
            “Bama,” and dog mom to five.
            Somewhere in all that, I even try to remember to brush my teeth.
            It’s chaotic, sure. But it’s also mine.
            I’ve learned how to balance compassion with grit and rebuild from burnout with humor, caffeine, and a good
            playlist. Seriously, it’s amazing. Getting diagnosed with ADHD later in life explained a lot, like why I
            thrive on twelve open tabs and a challenge. I believe in second (and third, fourth, fifth, and eleventeenth)
            chances to reinvent yourself, and I’m living proof that growth doesn’t have an expiration date.
            “Stillness & Shenanigans” sums me up pretty well: a little calm, a little chaos, and a lot of caffeine.
            Between school, work, family, and a few too many side projects, I’m learning that balance doesn’t always
            look graceful, but it’s absolutely possible.
            This site is my version of that balance. A mix of what I’ve learned, what I’m building, and the things that
            keep me grounded (and occasionally entertained). It’s proof that you can rebuild, rebrand, and rediscover
            yourself at any stage… as long as you keep showing up. Even if your coffee’s gone cold. (That’s what
            microwaves are for.)
